# Hi, I'm Yuri 👋

Recent Statistics graduate from the University of Geneva with a background in economics, passionate about turning complex data into actionable insights. My master's thesis developed non-parametric methods for conditional distribution forecasting in time series, with applications to extreme event prediction and uncertainty quantification.

I use this GitHub to continuously learn and apply my skills through data science and data analysis projects.


## 📂 Projects

**[Time Series Engression](https://github.com/Croci-Yuri/Time_Series_Engression_Master_Thesis)** – Master's thesis project extending the Engression framework for temporal forecasting.
- Developed a non-parametric model that captures full conditional distributions with temporal dependencies and input-dependent noise, enabling reliable uncertainty quantification and improved prediction of extreme events. Compared and evaluated on synthetic data and applied to extreme flood prediction in Swiss river discharge datasets.

**[Movie Recommendation System](https://github.com/Croci-Yuri/Movie_Recommendation_System)** – Investigation and Implementation of Recommendation Models on [MovieLens 1M dataset](https://grouplens.org/datasets/movielens/).   
- This project covers data exploration, preprocessing, and systematic comparison of content-based filtering, memory-based collaborative filtering, and model-based approaches. Based on performance insights, I designed a hybrid model to improve recommendation accuracy across both warm and cold-start scenarios.
