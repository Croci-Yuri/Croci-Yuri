# Hi, I'm Yuri 👋

Recent Statistics graduate from the University of Geneva with a background in economics, passionate about turning complex data into actionable insights. My master's thesis developed non-parametric methods for conditional distribution forecasting in time series, with applications to extreme event prediction and uncertainty quantification.

## 📂 Projects

**[Time Series Engression](https://github.com/Croci-Yuri/Time_Series_Engression_Master_Thesis)** – Master's thesis project extending the Engression framework for temporal forecasting.
- Developed a non-parametric model in PyTorch that captures full conditional distributions with temporal dependencies and input-dependent noise, enabling reliable uncertainty quantification and improved prediction of extreme events. Compared and evaluated on synthetic data and applied to extreme flood prediction in Swiss river discharge datasets.

**[Hybrid Movie Recommendation System](https://github.com/Croci-Yuri/Hybrid_Movie_Recommendation_System)** – Exploration and evaluation of recommendation algorithms on the [MovieLens 20M dataset](https://grouplens.org/datasets/movielens/20m/).   
- Conducted data exploration, preprocessing, and systematic comparison of content-based filtering, memory-based collaborative filtering, and model-based approaches. Based on performance insights, designed a hybrid neural network in PyTorch to improve recommendation accuracy across both warm-start and cold-start scenarios.

<br>

**[Loan Default Prediction](https://github.com/Croci-Yuri/Home_Credit_Risk_Analysis)** – Credit risk modeling and customer segmentation using the [Home Credit Default Risk dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/c/home-credit-default-risk).
- Developed a LightGBM classification model to predict loan defaults on 300,000+ applications using SQL on BigQuery for data processing, Python for feature engineering and model optimization, and Power BI for visualization. Based on model predictions, performed customer risk segmentation to identify characteristics that distinguish risk tiers and inform credit evaluation strategies.
