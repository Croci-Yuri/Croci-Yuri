# Hi, I'm Yuri 👋

Recent Statistics graduate from the University of Geneva, passionate about turning complex data into actionable insights. My master's thesis developed non-parametric methods for conditional distribution forecasting in time series, applied to extreme event prediction.

I use this GitHub to continuously learn and apply my knowledge through diverse machine learning and data science projects.

## 📂 Projects
