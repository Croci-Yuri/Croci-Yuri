# Hi, I'm Yuri 👋

Recent Statistics graduate from the University of Geneva, passionate about turning complex data into actionable insights. My master's thesis developed non-parametric methods for conditional distribution forecasting in time series, with applications to extreme event prediction.

I use this GitHub to continuously learn and apply my skills through data science and data analysis projects.

## 📂 Projects

**[Time Series Engression](https://github.com/Croci-Yuri/Time_Series_Engression_Master_Thesis)** – Master's thesis implementation on extending the Engression framework to temporal forecasting.   
This work extends Engression to model full conditional distributions with temporal dependencies and input-dependent noise, enabling reliable uncertainty quantification and improved prediction of extreme events on synthetic and real-world river discharge data.

**[Movie Recommendation System](https://github.com/Croci-Yuri/Movie_Recommendation_System)** *[In Progress]* – A Comparative Study of Collaborative Filtering Approaches built on the [MovieLens 1M dataset](https://grouplens.org/datasets/movielens/). 
The project covers initial data cleaning and exploratory data analysis, followed by the implementation and comparison of memory-based, content-based, model-based, and hybrid collaborative filtering approaches, evaluated under warm and cold start settings.
